CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology
What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting? Prioritize the issues into groups and then work the issues in the order of priority.
What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process? Test the solution, implement the solution, verify it and then document everything. Document for the customer, then for the company, and then for yourself.
What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base? The ability to recall it. The ability to recall the issues and the fixes can help with priority of how tickets should be prioritized and a quicker troubleshooting time.
Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-user’s cultural background? I’d try the troubleshooting techniques and see how far I’d get without the help and then reach and explain all of my steps.
